Nautilus Checksums
==================

Add checksums to Nautilus' properties window


Get involved
------------

The package needs help with internationalization. If a translation into your
language is missing and you wish to get involved, here is what to do.

Let's say you want to create a Dutch translation of **Nautilus Checksums**
(`nl`). First thing to do is to make sure that **GNU Autotools** and **GNU
gettext** are installed on your system. Then clone this repository and launch
the following commands:

``` sh
./bootstrap
make -C po nautilus-checksums.pot
(cd po && msginit -l nl)
./bootstrap --clean
```

Now edit the `po/LINGUAS` file and add a new line containing the abbreviated
name of the new language (`nl`).

Finally, open the `po/nl.po` file and translate the strings present. All you
have to do now is to commit your changes.

For any issue, [drop a message][1].


Installation
------------

On most Unix-like systems, you should be able to install this package using the
following common steps:

``` sh
./configure
make
make install-strip
```

If the `strip` utility is not available on your machine, use `make install`
instead (it will produce larger binaries).

If the `configure` script is missing from your package you need to generate it
by running the `bootstrap` script. By default, `bootstrap` will also run the
`configure` script immediately after having generated it, so you may type the
`make` command directly after `bootstrap`. To list different options use
`./bootstrap --help`.

For further information, see [INSTALL][2].
